Hi, I am a humanitarian practictioner with experience in delivering impactful assistance and protection services with integrity and dignity to the affected people in countries affected by armed conflict. In doing so, I seek to ensure the safety and security of my staff by applying the minimum security requirements defined by my organization and continously keeping abreast of potential risks. In my role as a security manager, I seek to develop my expertise by learning essential cybersecurity skills.
